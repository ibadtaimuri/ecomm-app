<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Furniro E-commerce Website

This is an e-commerce website built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React. It showcases various products for sale, allowing users to view product details, add them to the cart, and navigate between pages like the homepage, product pages, cart, and checkout.
Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a fully functional e-commerce website that includes features like product listing, product details, a cart, and checkout functionality. The website's layout and design are fully responsive and mobile-friendly, which means it looks great on all devices (like phones, tablets, and desktops).

This project helps me practice building a modern web application with the following tools and technologies:

    Next.js: A React framework that makes building static and dynamic web pages easy.
    Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that helps style the website quickly and efficiently.
    React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used here for handling state and rendering components.

Key Components Implemented

    Navbar: A navigation bar at the top of the website that allows users to access different pages like the home page, shop, cart, and contact page.
    Homepage: Displays a welcoming banner, featured products, and other sections like "Our Products" and "Inspiration".
    Product Pages: A product listing page (Shop) and individual product pages (Product Detail) where users can view product details, add them to the cart, and see related products.
    Cart Sidebar: A mini sidebar that opens when a user adds a product to the cart. This sidebar shows the list of items in the cart and allows users to check out.
    Checkout Page: A page where users can fill in their shipping information, view the products in their cart, and complete their order.
    Footer: Contains links to important pages like Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, and social media links.
    Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, meaning it looks good on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. Tailwind CSS helps achieve this with ease.
    Dynamic Routing: Using Next.js's dynamic routing, users can access individual product pages based on the product ID in the URL.
